Virtual memory is an abstraction, an illusion used to make system think that the main memory is large. Main memory is called physical memory because it is real capacity of hardware storage. In the excercise 1, bash command 'free -t -h' showed that on my laptop, which has 8GB RAM (physical memory), virtual memory is 32GB,which is 4 times larger. And this is in fact the amount of memory all of the applciations think they can work with.
